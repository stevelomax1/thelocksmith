The Locksmith (Password Generator)

This site was designed to generate random passwords that meet different, unique, and specific criterias selected. The purpose is to create a strong password that would provide great and solid security for those looking to protect sensitive information. Users can access the a variety of password possibilities such as upper or lowercase, character limits, numbers, and special characters. 

HTML and CSS are used as the started code foundation however Javascript is what I used to power the code and to give my generator functionality.

The password generator will be a helpful tool for those looking to added security.
